**Decentralized News Platform**

This project implements a decentralized news platform built on the Ethereum blockchain and the Sepolia testnet, utilizing the power of smart contracts and Web3 technologies.

**Key Features**

* **Immutable News Storage:** Articles are stored on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and resistance to censorship or unauthorized changes.
* **Publisher and Reader Roles:** The system supports distinct roles for publishers and readers, with appropriate permissions.
* **Reputation System:** (If implemented) Publishers maintain a reputation score, influencing the visibility of their articles.
* **Content Access Control (If implemented):** Mechanisms for controlling access based on subscriptions or other models.

**Technologies**

* **Solidity:** Smart contract development.
* **Ethers.js (or Web3.js):** Web3 library for interacting with Ethereum.
* **React.js:** Frontend development.
* **Hardhat (or Truffle):** Development and testing framework.
* **MetaMask:** For user interaction with the blockchain.
* **IPFS (Optional):** For decentralized content storage.

**Project Setup**

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo-name>.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**
   * Create a `.env` file in the root of your project.
   * Add the following variables, replacing placeholders:
     ```
     INFURA_PROJECT_ID=<Your Infura Project ID>
     PRIVATE_KEY=<Your MetaMask Wallet's Private Key>
     ```

**Deployment**

1. **Compile contracts:**
   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

2. **Deploy contracts to Sepolia testnet:**
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia
   ```

   * Note the deployed contract address.

3. **Update frontend configuration:**
   * Update the contract address and ABI in your frontend's Web3 configuration files.

**Usage**

* **Connect MetaMask:** Ensure MetaMask is installed, switched to the Sepolia testnet, and has some test ETH.
* **Register as a Publisher (if applicable):** Use the provided interface to register.
* **Submit Articles:** Publishers can submit articles through the designated interface.
* **View Articles:** Readers can access and view published articles.
